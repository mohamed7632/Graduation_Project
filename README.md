 ## __Sentiment analysis website__ 
 ### __Our scope here is__ 
 * collecting data from social media like twitter, by fetching the tweets from it using twitter API.
 *  Also scrape Amazon data to collect more reviews on the products.
 * Analyze the data collected from both platforms in order to provide the users with charts contain summarizations abou negative and positive tweets for what they are searching for
### Our objective is to make a sentiment analysis website that will be able to do the following:
* Search for such product (Ex. iPhone 11) and then analysis will be made on
tweets extracted from both twitter and amazon and show charts with what
people think or say about him (Positive & Negative) and show a sample of
the tweets and amazon reviews fetched with the sentimentâ€™s status beside.
* Users will be able to register to save all the liked topics they searched for in
order to get back to the tweets and charts and to track the updates made
about these topics.
